Description: Protein Group Code Algorithm (PGCA) is a computationally
        inexpensive algorithm to merge protein summaries from multiple
        experimental quantitative proteomics data. The algorithm
        connects two or more groups with overlapping accession numbers.
        In some cases, pairwise groups are mutually exclusive but they
        may still be connected by another group (or set of groups) with
        overlapping accession numbers. Thus, groups created by PGCA
        from multiple experimental runs (i.e., global groups) are
        called "connected" groups. These identified global protein
        groups enable the analysis of quantitative data available for
        protein groups instead of unique protein identifiers.
